##Overview
* **Cryptographic algorithms and protocols** :
 * **Symmetric encryption**:Used to conceal the contents of blocks or streams of data of any size, including messages, files, encryption keys, and passwords.
 * **Asymmetric encryption**: Used to conceal small blocks of data, such as encryption keys and hash function values, which are used in digital signatures.
 * **Data integrity algorithms**: Used to protect blocks of data, such as messages, from alteration.
 * **Authentication protocols**: These are schemes based on the use of cryptographic algorithms designed to authenticate the identity of entities.
* **Computer Security**: The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability,
and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications).

#### CIA
* **Confidentiality**: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information
* **Integrity**: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
* **Availability**: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system.

####Other important Label
* **Authenticity**: The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator. This means verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source
* **Accountability** or **Non-repudiation**: The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and afteraction recovery and legal action. Because truly secure systems are not yet an
achievable goal, we must be able to trace a security breach to a responsible party. Systems must keep records of their activities to permit later forensic analysis to trace security breaches or to aid in transaction disputes
